# Fast-Food Chains Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes data from the top 50 fast-food chains in the USA to understand various trends and relationships using Python's data analysis and machine learning libraries.

## Overview

The project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building machine learning models:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
- Evaluating model performance and visualizing results

## Data Source

The dataset `Top 50 Fast-Food Chains in USA.csv` contains information on the top fast-food chains including their sales, units, and other relevant metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Installation

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to execute the analysis and models.

2. Explore the following functionalities:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (`EDA.ipynb`):
  - Basic information, data description, duplicates, null values, and data types.
  - Boxplot and correlation heatmap.
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Decision Tree Classifier (`Decision_Tree.ipynb`).
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (`KNN.ipynb`).
  - K-Means Clustering (`KMeans_Clustering.ipynb`).
  - Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (`Gradient_Descent.ipynb`).
  - Evaluation metrics and visualizations for each model.

3. Each notebook provides detailed steps and visualizations to understand the insights derived from the data.

## Results

- Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved accuracy of XX% on the test set.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Found optimal k=3 with accuracy of XX%.
- K-Means Clustering: Identified XX clusters based on sales and units.
- Linear Regression: Predicted sales per unit with MSE and R-squared error of XX and XX respectively.

## Future Enhancements

- Feature engineering and selection for improved model performance.
- Deploying models as APIs for real-time predictions.
- Incorporating additional datasets for comprehensive analysis.
